Hey!

My name is Duong Tam Kien but you can call me "TK" if you are not confident about pronounciation or just want to keep it hiphop.

I graduated in social sciences and applied mathematics but also worked in the information industry since 2001. I have some interests in design specialy generative approaches and language patterns. After having work in various companies, public institutes and as a freelancer, I perform most of my works about collective intelligence, data visualization, data science, and learning technologies at the [CRI](http://cri-paris.org).
