 title: "Where the semantic web stumbled, linked data will succeed"

<blockquote>
<p>Linked data will triumph in this space because efforts to date focus less on the how and more on the why. RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and triple stores are onerous. URIs, micro-formats, RDFa, and JSON, less so. Why invest in difficult technologies if consumer outcomes can be realized with extant tools and knowledge? We have the means to realize linked data now -- the pieces of the puzzle are there and we (just) need to put them together.</p>
