 title: "The last viridian note - Bruce Sterling"
---

C'est marrant, j'ai comme l'impression ces derniers temps de ne parler que de Bruce Sterling, en particulier ses textes sur le design d'objet. Malheureusement le temps de trouver la mailing list du "mouvement viridian":http://www.viridiandesign.org/ voilà que son auteur principal décide d'y mettre un terme en nous livrant au passage une belle leçon sur le glocal lifestyle.

<blockquote>

Is your home a museum?  Do you have curatorial skills?  If not, then entropy is attacking everything in there.  Stuff breaks, ages, rusts, wears out, decays. Entropy is an inherent property of time and space. Understand this fact. Expect this.  The laws of physics are all right, they should not provoke anguished spasms of denial.

You will be told that you should "make do" with broken or semi-broken tools, devices and appliances.  Unless you are in prison or genuinely crushed by poverty, do not do this.  This advice is wicked.

This material culture of today is not sustainable.  Most of the things you own are almost certainly made to 20th century standards, which are very bad. If we stick with the malignant possessions we already have, through some hairshirt notion of thrift, then we are going to be baling seawater.  This will not do.

You should be planning, expecting, desiring to live among material surroundings created, manufactured, distributed, through radically different methods from today's. It is your moral duty to aid this transformative process. This means you should encourage the best industrial design.

Get excellent tools and appliances.  Not a hundred bad, cheap, easy ones.  Get the genuinely good ones.  Work at it.  Pay some attention here, do not neglect the issue by imagining yourself to be serenely "non-materialistic."  There is nothing more "materialistic" than doing the same household job five times because your tools suck. Do not allow yourself to be trapped in time-sucking black holes of mechanical dysfunction. That is not civilized.

<blockquote>

What is "sustainability?"  Sustainable practices navigate successfully through time and space, while others crack up and vanish.  So basically, the sustainable is about time -- time and space.  You need to re-think your relationship to material possessions in terms of things that occupy your time.  The things that are physically closest to you.  Time and space.
