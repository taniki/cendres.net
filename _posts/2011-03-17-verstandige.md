> To reach rational knowledge by our intelligence is the just demand of the mind which comes to science. For intelligence, understanding (*Verstand*), is thinking, pure activity of the self in general; and what is intelligible (*VerstÃ¤ndige*) is something from the first familiar and common to the scientific and unscientific mind alike, enabling the unscientific mind to enter the domain of science.

I'm still sure I won't be pro-Hegel. Reading it is not that hard if one use a very patient approach. Maybe I'll blog about it or maybe I will wait the summer reading class.

It is also a perfect timing with yesterday's projection of [Chris Marker's Sans Soleil](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8240960507863855068#) at the [cine alfinete](http://altesfinanzamt.blogspot.com/p/cine-alfinete.html) (1euro/month, nice people, great discussions). I didn't see a lot about the cinematographic because of how the narrative was completly echoing hegelian topics. I now have a perfect example of dialectical representation of truth in cinema.
