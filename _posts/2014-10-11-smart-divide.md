> The pursuit of smartness is merely another name for a technological escape from our bewildering and taxing social milieu. Meanwhile, emboldened no doubt by the success of many privately built gated communities, the Sanathana Dharama Parirakshana Trust from Sringeri has taken the pursuit of smartness to new heights. On offer at a site about 40 kilometres from Bangalore is the first exclusively Brahmin community township, a vedic village no less, with a temple complex, a Veda Pathasala, Goshala, alternative medicine centre, etc. Houses curving around the auspicious symbol of ‘Om’ will ensure its inhabitants protection from the rough and tumble of Indian democracy.

With "open" (later might come about this one later), "smart" is certainly one of those keywords that people should pay attention because of its overratedness. The article for ___the hindu___ is worth a read. It shows at which extends "smart" is both a way for western cities to emphasize what they should do since a long time ago, what they do by pouring money over the middle class and ostracize the lower class that cannot affort to be "smart". On the other side, what happens when this social logic is translated to BRIC megacities is a way to tell emerging countries to follow western standards (for own top-tier survival) with extra unequalities as a bonus. Sure that is good when money got diverted to such pathways but also it hides how "smart" is part of techo-corporate jargon that does not even try to solve social inequalities issues. It does not tell that being "smart" has a cost and that revenue is not profit for the poors but for the happy fews that know how to deploy it. Your "smart" home drived by a [NEST](http://nest.com) thermostat lessen your carbon footprint and you electricity bill but your smartness is still own by the device, its patents and its legal owners.

Let even not speak about what happens to your data and how "smartness" is computed by using "big data" algorithms that needs massive collected intelligence to be pertinent ___i.e.___ profitable.
