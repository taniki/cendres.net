 title: "It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be - Paul Arden"

<blockquote> <p>There is a little demand in the commercial world for excellence. There is a much, much bigger demand for mediocrity.</p><p>The truth is, I'm glad this way.</p><p>Imagine a world where all clients wer ewonderful, where we could produce whatever we felt like with no restrictions, with everybody having freedom to produce all their fantasies unfettered by tedious clients.</p><p>What would we do?</p><p>We would react against it, saying, ‘isn't this boring. How can we be dull? Let's do it badly, let's make it ugly, and let's make it really cheaply.’</p><p>That's the nature of the creative person. <strong>All creative people need something to rebel against</strong>, it's what gives their lives excitement, and it's creative people who make the clients' lives exciting.</p><cite>Why do we strive for excellence when mediocrity is required ?, Paul Arden</cite>  </blockquote>
