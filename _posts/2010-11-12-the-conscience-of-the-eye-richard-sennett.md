<blockquote>
<p>The economic history of the grid points to a simple, large truth. Possessing power is quite different than using it to one's own advantage. This large, simple truth is important in understanding the power to neutralize a city. Those who could do so were disturbed in their pursuits by a set of difficulties inherent in the very act of treating the world neutrally.</p>
